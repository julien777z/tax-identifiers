# Python Rules

## Syntax and Typing

- Use modern type hints: `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`.
- Use built-in generics: `list[T]`, `dict[K, V]` instead of `List[T]`, `Dict[K, V]`.
- Use `Self` from `typing` for class method return types.
- Use `collections.abc` for abstract types: `Callable`, `Iterable`, etc.
- Never use `Protocol` for model typing; use concrete model classes in type annotations.

- Model structured payloads explicitly: use `TypedDict` for mapping-shaped data and Pydantic `BaseModel` for every data-holding class, rather than arbitrary inline dictionaries, `dict[str, object]`, `dataclass`, or `NamedTuple`.
- Use exact types or precise unions for dynamic and nested shapes; never hide their contracts behind `Any` or placeholder `object` fields in application or test annotations.
- Prefer real SDK and model types over `cast(...)`; reserve a narrowly scoped cast for information the type system genuinely cannot express.
- Do not "fix" typing by expanding simple transformations into repetitive key-by-key copy blocks (for example, manually assigning each dict key only to satisfy pyright). Fix the source type hints (or add a precise cast/narrowing at the boundary) so the transformation can stay concise and readable.
- For persistence/update payloads (for example, `upsert(...)`), define a dedicated `TypedDict` and construct it inline at the call site. Do not add free-floating `build_*`/`make_*` helper functions whose only role is constructing a payload from another shape; the same no-free-floating-builders rule that applies to `BaseModel` applies here.
- When a `TypedDict` types a module-level constant or other shared blob (for example a CVA style config), build the value by **calling** the TypedDict constructor with keyword arguments (`MyTypedDict(field=value, ...)`) instead of assigning an annotated plain dict literal (`name: MyTypedDict = {...}`). Use the same for nested TypedDict rows inside lists (for example `CompoundVariantRule(match={...}, class_name="...")`). This keeps the type as the construction site, not only a static annotation on a dict literal. Requires Python 3.12+.

- Group parameters that always travel together and describe one concept into a single typed object, then pass that object rather than threading its fields through every signature and call site.

```python
from typing import TypedDict


class RequestContext(TypedDict):
    source_address: str | None
    client_name: str | None


# Bad: related values threaded as separate arguments
def record_event(event: Event, source_address: str | None, client_name: str | None) -> None:
    ...


# Good: one typed object describing the shared concept
def record_event(event: Event, request_context: RequestContext) -> None:
    ...
```

- Use `datetime` objects instead of raw integers (Unix timestamps) for representing time.
- Use `timedelta` for durations instead of raw integers (for example, `timedelta(seconds=10)` instead of `10`).
- For database columns, use `DateTime` or `Date` types from SQLAlchemy.
- For Pydantic models, use `datetime.datetime` or `datetime.date` types.

- Use a leading underscore **only** for nested definitions: a function defined inside another function or method (inner function), and a class defined inside another class (inner class).
- Everything else must **not** start with a leading underscore. This includes module-level functions, classes, Pydantic/ORM models, enums, `TypedDict`s, type aliases, and constants; **methods** (instance methods, `@classmethod`, and `@staticmethod`); and **module / file names**.
- Do not use a leading underscore to mark a method or a module-level helper as "private". Express privacy through module boundaries and `__all__` instead.
- This rule does not govern Python dunders (`__init__`, `__enter__`, …) or single-underscore names owned by third-party/stdlib code.

```python
class Report(BaseModel):
    @classmethod
    def from_rows(cls, rows: list[Row]) -> Self:
        def _format_row(row: Row) -> str:
            return f"{row.id}: {row.name}"

        return cls(lines=[_format_row(row) for row in rows])
```

- Prefer string enums for string-valued domains instead of loose string constants.

## Imports and Modules

- Never name a module by joining two different concepts with an underscore — `resource_export.py` is "resource" + "export". Create a package for the entity and a topic module inside it: `resource/export.py`. The same applies when adding a second module for an entity that already has one (`resource.py` + `resource_access.py` must become the package `resource/` with `resource.py` and `access.py` inside).
- Inside an entity package, do not repeat the entity in module names: `resource/sync.py`, never `resource/resource_sync.py`.
- Compound nouns that name a single concept are one entity, not two — `access_control.py`, `request_metadata.py`, and `audit_trail.py` are all fine.
- When the entity package needs a module for its primary/orchestration surface, name it after the package (`resource/resource.py`) with an empty `__init__.py`; consumers import the specific submodule.

- Do not start Python files with module docstrings. Begin with imports, or leave package `__init__.py` files empty when they have no public surface.
- Keep ALL imports at the top of the file.
- Never import inside functions, methods, or test cases.
- Group imports: stdlib, third-party, local (separated by blank lines).
- Prefer **absolute imports** from the top-level package (for example `from application.routes.resources import router`) over **relative imports** with parent segments (for example `from ....routes.resources import router`). Absolute imports are stable when modules move, easier to grep, and avoid brittle `..` depth. Same rule applies to other installable packages: always anchor imports on the package name, not on the file’s directory depth.
- Never use import aliases for project modules; import the canonical symbol/module name and update call sites to that name instead of aliasing.
- Use `__all__` exports in module `__init__.py` files.
- Never define variables or call functions in between import statements; all imports must be contiguous at the top of the file.
- Never create shim modules that only re-export symbols from another package for backwards compatibility; update all consumers to import from the canonical source instead.
- Put generic reusable functions in the package's `utils.py`, even when they currently have one caller; keep domain-specific behavior in its owning module, and extract a focused module or package only when a cohesive domain or external boundary warrants it.
- Narrow exception: `__main__.py` entrypoints may use same-package relative imports for bootstrap (for example `from .runtime import main`), and `__init__.py` may use explicit relative imports when assembling the package’s public surface.

### Entrypoints

- Keep `__main__.py` and script entrypoints thin.
- Entrypoints only bootstrap and call a `main()` function from a dedicated runtime or service module.
- Keep orchestration loops, transaction flow, and business logic in regular modules rather than entrypoint files.

```python
# Bad: shim module that only re-exports symbols
from .http_transport import fetch, fetch_with_cache

__all__ = ["fetch", "fetch_with_cache"]

# Bad: consuming through a shim module
from myapp.http import fetch

# Good: import from the canonical source directly
from myapp.http_transport import fetch
```

- Prefer real fixes (annotations, stubs, deps). If a Pylint/static warning is a false positive or unfixable in our code (for example lazy third-party exports, missing stubs), use a **narrow** suppression: `# pylint: disable-next=<message-id>` on the smallest scope—never file-wide disables or import workarounds whose only purpose is to satisfy the checker.

```python
# pylint: disable-next=not-callable
config = third_party_package.Config(
    app_name="example",
)
```

## Configuration

- Define the repository's settings in one descriptively named `BaseSettings` class such as `ActionConfig`, instantiate one module-level constant such as `ACTION_CONFIG = ActionConfig()`, and import that validated object wherever settings are needed.
- Put environment-backed, deployment-tunable, or intentionally overridable values in that settings class. This includes tool and CLI versions that are likely to change in future releases; do not freeze them as module constants.
- Give configurable values typed defaults when the repository has a safe default, and let `pydantic-settings` provide namespaced environment overrides.
- Use `TypedDict` only for static structured data that is not configuration.

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict


class ActionConfig(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_prefix="APPLICATION_", frozen=True)

    tool_cli_version: str = "1.2.3"
    request_timeout_seconds: int = 30


ACTION_CONFIG = ActionConfig()
```

- API keys and secrets must be **required** config fields with **no defaults** (no `= ""` or `| None = None` escape hatches); optionality is reserved for credentials with a documented ambient fallback (for example AWS IAM role credentials).
- Avoid large piles of module-level constants. If a value is genuinely operator-tunable, add it to the project's central config model or settings layer.
- Do not add useless config values like `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`.
- Do not add helper functions like `_get_environment` when the value already exists on the shared settings object.
- Do not read environment variables directly with `os.getenv`, `os.environ`, or `os.environ.get` in application/service/library code.
- Always read environment-backed values from the typed settings object so defaults, validation, and normalization live in one place.
- Exception: one-off scripts may read from `os` when introducing a settings model would be unnecessary overhead.

## Constants

- Define constants at the top of the file, after imports.
- Place module-level constants and enums (including type aliases like `AllowedApiClient`) directly after imports.
- Use `Final[T]` from `typing` and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE names for constants.
- Reserve constants for values that are genuinely invariant, such as compiled regexes, stable paths, or implementation sentinels. Values likely to change between releases or deployments belong in the typed settings class even when they have a default.
- Compile regular expressions once at module scope and call methods on the compiled pattern instead of passing pattern strings repeatedly to `re.match`, `re.search`, `re.fullmatch`, or `re.sub`.
- When a mutable object is annotated with `Final`, complete any setup-time mutation in the same expression as initialization instead of binding it first and mutating it on the next line.
- Only extract literals when they are reused or carry domain meaning; keep trivial single-use literals inline (for example, delimiters like `"-"` or `"."`).
- Never hard-code constants like HTTP status codes; use `HTTPStatus` from the `http` module instead.
- Prefer enums for error identifiers/messages instead of a constant per error string.

- **Never commit development or test secret values into application or library code** — not even to compare against them. Embedding a known dev key (or its hash) so the code can reject it just moves the secret *into* the codebase, which is the opposite of the goal. Real secrets live in the secrets manager; test secrets live in test configuration (`pyproject.toml` env), never in `.py` source.
- **Do not branch on the environment in application code to relax or vary security posture** (`if ENVIRONMENT == "development": allow the weaker cipher / skip the check`). Which crypto backend, keys, and credentials are used is a deployment concern: production sets the real backend and secrets, tests set test values via test config. Application code states the single required contract (for example "encryption is AWS/KMS") and lets it hold everywhere.
- **Let the owning library validate its own contract; do not duplicate it behind an environment gate.** If a third-party SDK already requires a key for its selected method, do not re-implement that check in our config with environment branches — that is redundant and drifts.

## Functions and Interfaces

Avoid trivial wrapper functions that add no value. A function that just returns its argument or applies a trivial fallback is noise:

- Return `bool` for binary domain outcomes; never return integer `0` or `1` as a boolean substitute. Translate booleans into process exit codes only at the CLI boundary.
- Do not rebind function arguments to a second local name when the value is unchanged (for example, `profile = obj`); name the parameter correctly at the signature instead.
- Do not add passthrough function or method parameters when every call site provides the value from one shared source (for example, forwarding `timeout_seconds` from `APPLICATION_CONFIG` in every call); read from that source directly where the value is used.

- Prefer normal attribute assignment over `object.__setattr__(...)` when mutating Pydantic models in validators or helper methods.
- Only use `object.__setattr__(...)` when normal assignment is genuinely unavailable (for example frozen models or descriptor bypass requirements), and keep that escape hatch explicit and justified.

```python
# Bad: useless wrapper
def resolve_config(config: Settings | None) -> Settings:
    return config or APPLICATION_CONFIG

def get_auth_secret(config: Settings | None = None) -> str:
    resolved = resolve_config(config)  # Unnecessary indirection
    return resolved.SECRET

# Good: inline the fallback
def get_auth_secret(config: Settings | None = None) -> str:
    resolved = config or APPLICATION_CONFIG
    return resolved.SECRET
```

## Architecture and Boundaries

- Files under a `models/` package contain only declarative models, enums, and behavior intrinsic to validating or representing those models. Do not put runtime registries, mappings, instantiated collaborators, filesystem layouts, I/O, or orchestration in model files.
- Put runtime mappings and operational behavior in the module that owns their use. A typed `config.py` built with `pydantic-settings` is the explicit exception: it may define settings models and instantiate the shared settings object.

- Application code (a function, method, property, class, constant, or field) with **zero non-test consumers** is dead code and must be deleted, along with the tests that only exist to exercise it.
- **Tests do not justify keeping otherwise-unused application code.** A test that asserts a symbol no other application code reads is testing a fabricated contract; delete the symbol and that test together rather than preserving the symbol "because it's covered".
- "Consumer" means live application/library code that reads the symbol — call sites, internal use by another live symbol, serialization, or a public package export in `__all__` that external packages import. Test modules are not consumers.
- A symbol reached only indirectly through another symbol that is itself dead is also dead; remove the whole unused chain.
- **Settings fields that populate environment variables consumed by a third-party library are not dead code**, even when no application code reads the field directly. If a dependency we rely on reads an env var at runtime (for example a library whose `Settings` reads `ENCRYPTION_METHOD`/`ENCRYPTION_KEY`), the field must stay on the shared settings object so the application sets that env var — the library is the consumer. Keep such fields and validate them where the environment requires it.

- For values persisted in databases, queues, or cross-service contracts (for example handler names, event names, state keys), use explicit constants or enums.
- Do not derive durable identifiers from implementation details like `function.__name__`.
- Keep durable identifiers in shared model/contract modules when they are used across services.

```python
from enum import StrEnum


class TaskHandlerKey(StrEnum):
    PROCESS_RESOURCE = "process_resource"

# Good: explicit durable key
register_task(task_type=TaskType.PROCESS_RESOURCE, handler_name=TaskHandlerKey.PROCESS_RESOURCE.value)

# Bad: fragile runtime-derived key
register_task(task_type=TaskType.PROCESS_RESOURCE, handler_name=handler.__name__)
```

- Avoid monolithic service modules that mix orchestration, third-party API calls, policy decisions, and data mappers.
- Split large services into focused modules, for example:
  - orchestration module (route-facing flow)
  - gateway module (external/internal API client calls)
  - domain helper modules (policy/state decisions, AI resolution, etc.)
- Keep public service function signatures stable while refactoring internals.
- **No upward imports**: `lib/` must never import from `services/`. Shared infrastructure both tiers need (client factories, session wiring, config) lives in `core/`, which either tier may import.
- **Orchestration does not live under `lib/`**: a module whose functions are route-facing entry points (they accept request-shaped inputs and return response models) belongs in `services/`, even if it started life as a helper. Keep the pure helpers (query builders, row/CSV machinery, mappers) in `lib/` and move only the orchestrator.
- **A transport-only "service" is a gateway**: a `services/` module whose functions only wrap internal-service or external API calls belongs in `lib/<domain>/gateway.py`; keeping it under `services/` invites upward imports from other lib modules.

- When multiple functions compute the same derived state (for example completion/missing stage lists), centralize that logic in one helper.
- Reuse the helper across read paths to avoid behavior drift.

- Keep explicit wrapper/helper functions for external dependencies so tests can patch clear module boundaries.
- Prefer patching module-level seams (for example `resource_gateway.fetch_resource`) over patching deep nested internals.

## Runtime Data and Caching

- Never use plain dictionaries (module-level, class-level, or any other in-process container) as caches for data that must stay correct across requests, workers, or deployments. In-process dict caches silently go stale, diverge between workers, and cannot be invalidated remotely.
- For cross-request or cross-process caching, use a distributed caching library such as Redis or the repository's shared caching layer, and always set an explicit TTL.
- Pair every cache write path with an explicit invalidation path for mutations that change the cached value.
- Request-scoped memoization is the only acceptable dict-shaped cache: it must be held in a `ContextVar`, reset at the start of every request, and invalidated on writes within the request.

- Use `@cache` (from `functools`) for expensive, deterministic builders that should be created once per process (for example, AI agents, parsed static configs, immutable lookup tables).
- Only cache functions whose return value is safe to reuse and does not depend on request-scoped state.
- Do not cache values that depend on mutable runtime inputs (per-request user data, DB sessions, auth context, timestamps).
- Keep cached builders side-effect free and parameter-light.

```python
from functools import cache

@cache
def build_classification_agent() -> Agent[None, ClassificationResult]:
    return Agent(...)
```

## Control Flow and Collections

- Combine conditional branches with `or` when they have the same body (including separate `if` statements and `if`/`elif` chains).
- Do not use an `if`/`else` block just to choose which attribute or mapping values to read. When the goal is only to select a source object and then read the same fields, resolve the source once with `or` and read from that single variable.

```python
# Good: combined conditions in one branch
if not principal.scope_id or principal.scope_id != scope_id:
    raise PermissionError("Principal cannot access this scope")

# Bad: separate branches with identical bodies
if not principal.scope_id:
    raise PermissionError("Principal cannot access this scope")

if principal.scope_id != scope_id:
    raise PermissionError("Principal cannot access this scope")
```

```python
# Good: resolve the source once, then read fields once
request_payload = request or {"name": ""}
resolved_name = request_payload["name"]
resolved_slug = request_payload.get("slug") or ""

# Bad: duplicated field extraction across branches
if request is None:
    resolved_name = ""
    resolved_slug = ""
else:
    resolved_name = request["name"]
    resolved_slug = request.get("slug") or ""
```

- For find-first patterns, use `next()` with a generator expression instead of a `for` loop with a nested `if` and early `return`/`break`.
- For filtering, prefer generator expressions or `filter(...)` over `for` loops that conditionally append to a list.

```python
# Bad: for loop with trivial nested if for find-first
for item in items:
    if item.id == target_id:
        return item.value

# Good: next() with generator expression
return next(
    (item.value for item in items if item.id == target_id),
    None,
)
```

- Use `match` statement instead of chains of `if`/`elif` statements when dispatching on enum members or discriminant values.
- For data-driven column/field selection with many independent boolean flags, prefer a declarative mapping iterated in a loop over repeated `if` blocks.
- Use enums with descriptive string values for column names, header labels, and other user-facing strings instead of raw string literals scattered across functions.

## External APIs and Errors

- Verify SDK method availability before coding integrations:
  - Prefer checking official docs with `@Browser`, or
  - Inspect the installed SDK directly (for example with Python `inspect`/`hasattr`) in the current environment.
- Do not add defensive attribute checks or fallback branches for third-party SDK methods (for example, catching `AttributeError` to try an alternate call path).
- Call the expected SDK method directly; if the integration changes, update it explicitly rather than supporting multiple speculative shapes in runtime code.

```python
# Bad: speculative fallback for a "maybe async, maybe sync" SDK shape
try:
    resources = await sdk.resources.list_async(
        scope_id=scope_id,
        resource_id=[resource_id],
        limit=1,
    )
except AttributeError:
    resource = sdk.resources.get(
        scope_id=scope_id,
        resource_id=resource_id,
    )

# Good: call the expected method directly
resources = await sdk.resources.list_async(
    scope_id=scope_id,
    resource_id=[resource_id],
    limit=1,
)
```

- Never insert fabricated placeholder values (for example `user-{id}@blank.com`) into database columns in application code to satisfy NOT NULL or UNIQUE constraints.
- If a required field is unavailable at a code path, fetch the real value from its authoritative source (for example an external identity provider API) or make the caller supply it.
- Placeholder backfills for legacy data belong exclusively in database migrations, not in runtime service logic.

- Implement only the single contract used by the current boundary (database schema, SDK contract, or API model).
- Do not widen types or add compatibility branches for alternate shapes that are not part of the real contract.
- Example: If the DB column type is `UUID`, function parameters and call sites should use `UUID` only (not `UUID | str` with runtime conversion).
- Prefer fixing call sites to provide the correct type over adding defensive conversion logic in core helpers.

```python
# Bad: backward-compatible branch for an unsupported secondary shape
async def get_source_id(session: AsyncSession, resource_id: UUID | str) -> str | None:
    resolved_resource_id = UUID(resource_id) if isinstance(resource_id, str) else resource_id
    resource = await Resource.get_one(session, where=Resource.id == resolved_resource_id)
    ...

# Good: single, complete implementation aligned to DB contract
async def get_source_id(session: AsyncSession, resource_id: UUID) -> str | None:
    resource = await Resource.get_one(session, where=Resource.id == resource_id)
    ...

# Good call site: convert once at boundary
raw_resource_id = response.json()["data"]["resource_id"]
source_id = await get_source_id(session, UUID(raw_resource_id))
```

- Read required data from its single canonical source — an SDK catalog/list call, a typed config value, a generated client — and use it directly. The implementation must be complete against that source, not hedged with a fallback.
- Do not wrap a canonical lookup in a `try`/`except` that swallows the failure and continues with a guessed value, a default, or a degraded mode. That hides drift and turns a real outage into silently wrong behavior. Let a genuine failure propagate to the normal error path so it fails loudly and gets fixed at the root.
- Handling a legitimate, expected *state* of the canonical data is fine (for example, a catalog entry that has no optional variant, so you use the base value). Inventing a substitute when the source is *unavailable or malformed* is not.
- If you catch yourself writing "if the lookup fails, use X instead", the fix is to make the lookup reliable (or to fail), not to paper over it with a fallback branch.

```python
# Bad: swallow a catalog failure and silently degrade to the default behavior
try:
    catalog = await client.list_models()
    variant = pick_variant(catalog)
except SomeError:
    variant = None  # silently falls back to the wrong/default behavior

# Good: use the canonical source completely; a real failure propagates to the caller's error path
catalog = await client.list_models()
variant = pick_variant(catalog)
```

- Use `HTTPStatus` enum from the `http` module instead of raw integer status codes.
- Import as: `from http import HTTPStatus`.
- Use your framework's standard error response type instead of hand-rolled JSON response bodies when the project already defines one.

```python
from http import HTTPStatus

# Good: use a typed or framework-standard error response
raise HttpError(
    status_code=HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND,
    detail="Resource not found",
)

# Bad: using raw integer status code with JSONResponse
return JSONResponse(
    status_code=404,
    content={"error": "Resource not found"},
)
```

- Never catch bare `Exception`; always catch specific exception types unless that broad exception is being explicitly tested in a test case.
- For generated or SDK-backed API clients, catch the library's documented exception type instead of broad exceptions.

```python
import third_party_client

# Good: catch specific exception
try:
    response = await client.get_resource(...)
except third_party_client.ApiException as exc:
    logger.warning("Resource API call failed: %s", exc)

# Bad: catch all exceptions
try:
    response = await client.get_resource(...)
except Exception as exc:
    logger.warning("API call failed: %s", exc)
```

## Formatting and Documentation

- Never use vague, cute, or placeholder terminology in identifiers, docstrings, comments, or test names. Name things for the behavior they actually have. This applies to **new and pre-existing code** — if you touch a file that still uses a banned term, rename it.
- Banned terms and what to use instead:
  - **"best effort"** — state the real contract. A function that swallows failures and reports the outcome should say so: name it `try_<verb>` (for example `try_send_email`) and document it as "returning whether it succeeded", not "best-effort".
  - **"seed" / "seeds" / "seeding"** (for test data or sample records) — name the helper for what it builds: a `<noun>_*_factory` fixture, `create_*`, or "sample data". Do not call setup data a "seed".
- If you reach for a placeholder-ish term a future reader could not decode from the name alone, pick a more intuitive name instead of adding it to this list.

- Add a blank line after each docstring.
- Never add decorative separator comments (for example, `# -----` headers).
- Add a blank line after multi-line statements (function calls, context managers, etc.) before the next statement.
- Add a blank line before terminating statements (`sys.exit()`, `return`, `raise`) to visually separate them from preceding code.
- Use blank lines as logical phase boundaries. Keep consecutive assignments or calculations together only when they jointly prepare one check, transformation, or result.
- Insert a blank line whenever adjacent statements advance to a different responsibility, even when both are short. In particular, separate an action from logging or other reporting; separate construction of an object from configuring or using it; and separate each independently configured parser or command group from the next.
- At module scope, separate runtime collaborators such as loggers from subsequent constants, type aliases, enum declarations, or configuration data. Keep the declarations together only when they form their own cohesive group.
- A short compact block (2–3 lines) may stay together only when every line directly contributes to the same operation. Do not use compactness alone as a reason to remove a logical boundary.
- When consecutive lines switch to a different statement kind (for example `assert` to a mock-verification call, or `setattr(...)` to an unrelated assignment), insert a blank line when the new statement begins a new logical group.
- Add a blank line after setup/initialization code before the main logic begins.

```python
# Good: blank line separates setup from main logic
artifacts_dir = tmp_path / "artifacts"
artifacts_dir.mkdir()

create_artifact(artifacts_dir, "first", None)
create_artifact(artifacts_dir, "second", "first")

# Bad: no separation between setup and main logic
artifacts_dir = tmp_path / "artifacts"
artifacts_dir.mkdir()
create_artifact(artifacts_dir, "first", None)
```

```python
# Good: related setup stays together, then one blank line introduces validation
start_marker = FORMAT["start_marker"]
end_marker = FORMAT["end_marker"]
start_count = content.count(start_marker)
end_count = content.count(end_marker)

if start_count != end_count:
    raise ValueError("Managed markers are malformed")
```

```python
# Good: action and reporting are separate responsibilities
perform_update(records)

logger.info("Update complete")

# Good: keep construction separate from later setup and use
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest="command", required=True)

create_parser = subparsers.add_parser("create")
create_parser.add_argument("--dry-run", action="store_true")

validate_parser = subparsers.add_parser("validate")
validate_parser.set_defaults(dry_run=False)

parsed_arguments = parser.parse_args(arguments)

# Good: a runtime collaborator is separate from module declarations
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

MAX_ITEMS: Final[int] = 20
ALLOWED_STATES: Final[frozenset[str]] = frozenset({"ready", "complete"})
```

- Add a blank line before multi-line assert statements.
- Do NOT put docstrings or comments at the top of files (no module-level docstrings, no module-level comments, and no encoding header comments like `# coding: utf-8`); `__init__.py` files should either be empty or contain only imports and `__all__`.

- Every **function**, **method**, and **class** should have a one-line docstring (purpose or role). Include `main()` and nested helpers the same way unless the file’s existing style omits docstrings on tiny locals—when in doubt, add one line.
- Keep docstrings to a single line. Do not include Args, Returns, or Raises sections.
- Class docstrings go directly after the class definition.
- Docstrings describe current behavior only — never reference what the code replaces, used to do, or PR/migration history. The docstring must read the same to a new reader who never saw the prior version.

- **Comments are only for third-party quirks** — an SDK bug, a library's surprising contract, a spec oddity, a protocol requirement — that a reader could not infer from our own code. If the reason lives in code you control, it is not a comment.
- **If your own code needs a comment to be understood, the code is too complex — refactor it instead.** Rename the identifier, extract a well-named helper, split the function, or restructure until the intent is obvious without prose. Reach for a comment only after the code cannot be made clearer and the remaining "why" is genuinely external.
- **Never explain behavior in a comment — tests assert behavior.** Do not narrate what a branch, guard, ordering, or invariant does or protects against; encode that in a test that fails when it regresses. The test is the durable, executable specification; the comment is not.
- **Keep any comment to 1–2 lines**, factual, and about the external quirk only. A comment that runs longer is a signal the code (or the abstraction) needs restructuring, not more prose.
- Comments describe the current external quirk only — never reference what the code replaces, used to do, what was deleted, the current task/fix/PR, or callers ("previously…", "legacy…", "now uses X instead of Y", "added for the Y flow", "used by X"). Those belong in the PR description, not the source.

## Logging

- Use the `logging` module instead of `print()` for debugging, status, progress, or diagnostics in any code, including scripts and CLI tools.
- Configure a logger at the top of each module: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
- Treat logger instances as runtime collaborators: name them `logger`, never `LOGGER`, and do not annotate them as `Final`.
- Use appropriate log levels: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`.

## Guardrails

- Do not remove intentional feature logic merely because it looks extra; verify the active request, nearby tests, and call sites before deleting newly added code.
- If style-cleanup instructions conflict with clear feature intent, preserve behavior first and ask a clarifying question instead of removing the feature code.
