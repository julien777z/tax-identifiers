# GitHub Rules

## Workflows

- Do not hard-code runtime versions when a shared action, reusable workflow, or repository version file supplies them; omit `python-version` when shared Python automation provides it, and use `node-version-file: ".nvmrc"` for Node.js workflows.
- Add an explanatory comment when an edge case requires an explicit version override.
- Use version-tagged GitHub Actions such as `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-python@v5`, not full commit SHAs.

## Branches and Pull Requests

- Keep pull requests focused and give them descriptive titles and descriptions; request appropriate reviewers when the repository workflow requires them.
- When additional work arrives on a non-default branch, retain that branch and add the work to its pull request even when the task could be reviewed independently.
- Query the current branch's pull request before creating one. Reuse it while it is open, or create one from the current branch when none exists.
- Create a separate branch only when the user asks or the current branch's pull request is already merged; start post-merge work from the default branch.

## Commits

- Use conventional commit messages when applicable and keep commits atomic and focused.
- Do not commit generated files unless the repository explicitly requires them.

## Dependency Installation

- Declare project dependencies used by workflows in the repository's dependency manifests and commit their lockfiles.
- Run project-level installation commands such as `poetry install` or `npm install` in workflows.
- Do not install individual project packages or embed their versions directly in workflow commands.

## README

- Describe available capabilities without assuming how consumers will use the project or framing guidance as prohibitions such as "never do X."
- Remove repeated explanations and prefer short sections, bullets, tables, and focused examples over long prose.

### GitHub Actions And Libraries

- Lead with the consumer-facing purpose; do not state that an action or library is reusable when that is already evident from the project.
- Place a concise, list-based Features section immediately after the introduction.
- Include little to no implementation or internal technical detail; describe public capabilities and outcomes instead.
- Follow Features with an Example or Examples section.
- Introduce each example with a one- or two-line description of its purpose, followed by a small code example.
- In cron-based examples, use a conventional schedule such as every Monday and add an inline comment translating the cron expression into that plain-language schedule.
- For reusable GitHub Actions, include an Inputs table with the input name, default value, and purpose.
- Include a Local Development section with the commands needed to install, run, and validate the project locally.

### Titles

- Write the top-level heading in every `README.md` in title case.
- Convert slug-style project names into readable words, such as `example-service` becoming `Example Service`.

## Guardrails

- Never commit or push agent-authored changes directly to the default branch. If the checkout is on the default branch or detached, create a descriptive non-default branch; otherwise retain the current branch and deliver through its pull request.
